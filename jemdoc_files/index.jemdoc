=== Class info

*Time*: Tuesday 13:30-16:55PM

*Location*: A306A

This 11-week seminar course is geared towards first or second-year graduate students who are interested in the fundamental aspects and the state-of-art developments of machine learning techniques. 
In this semester, we will cover a number of representation learning topics, including sparse representation, generative modeling, transformer-based language models, and deep graph representation learning. 

*Prerequisites*: Students who have taken a graduate-level introductory machine learning class (e.g. Learning from Data or its equivalent) and received a final grade of B or above. Sufficient background in math, probability and optimization for understanding research papers is also expected.

For more information about the class policies, see the [./media/dss-syllabus.pdf class syllabus].

Throughout this course, we will use the *Role-Playing* format to read and discuss papers. For detailed descriptions, please refer to the [./media/role_playing_doc.pdf role-playing document].
